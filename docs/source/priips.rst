PRIIPS Performance Statistics
=============================
The EU introduced PRIIPs (Packaged Retail and Insurance-based Investment Products) Regulations in 2016. These regulations require funds to report their risk level and
performance scenarios in a Key Information Document or KID. The aim of the regulations was to report risk and performance data in a standardised way allowing investors 
to easily compare different investments. The regulations separated funds into 4 separate categories. Category 2 funds are funds consisting of linear instruments such as 
equities that have access to a history of returns data. 

Category 2 PRIIPS can report performance forecasts using the Cornish Fisher approximation for percentiles
